# React Pomodoro

[See it live](https://estevanmaito.github.io/react-timer)

This is a complete rewrite of another project of mine, [Pomodoro Timer](https://github.com/estevanmaito/pomodoro-timer), writen using Vue.

The main differences between both projects are:

- This project is still unpolished. Although it works properly, it's ugly and a WIP;
- Obviously, the library used.

## TODO

- Notification API
- Mute sound alert
- Visualize pomodoros history in a graphical way, instead of just a number
- Finish UI
